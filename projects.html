                        <h3>ROS2 Autonomous Maze Solver</h3>
                        <p>
                            I spent some time working with a partner on a software package to solve a simple maze. 
                            The maze was constructed such that signs on the walls pointed the way to the goal, 
                            and were key to solving the maze. My partner and I created a ROS2/Python package to solve 
                            the maze by using machine learning to predict what the signs are, and then traveling to 
                            waypoints using ROS2 NAV2. A simple conditional state machine controlled when the robot 
                            moved forward and when it attempted to classify. Fallback behaviors were included in the case of
                            bad readings or incorrect positioning. Our final submission achieved 90% sign classification accuracy, 
                            and was able to complete the maze properly and without error in 5/6 tests. The code we used can 
                            be seen in my Github.

                        <h3>Fluor CIP Skid</h3>
                        <p>
                            I worked with a team of seven other Clemson ME students to design a Clean-In-Place Skid system to 
                            specifications laid out by the Fluor Corporation. I focused heavily on the conceptual design side of the project, 
                            doing much of my work in the areas of CAD design, flow and heat calculations, and equipment purchasing. 
                            I also acted as the Group Liason, ensuring useful and professional communcation with the sponsors at Fluor, 
                            the advisors at Clemson, and any suppliers we spoke with. Our final design included a second heat exchanger to recycle
                            heat from the primary heat exchanger, and three pumps to allow for maximum flow rate control. Our design came in second
                            at a showcase involving other universities.

                        <h3>VEX Compatible Planetary Wheels</h3>
                        <p>
                            I started this project with the goal of innovating on conventional VEX Robotics drivetrains by 
                            improving the space efficiency of the systems. My goal was to design a wheel that could fit a 
                            planetary gear train inside of it to enable competitive drivetrain speeds while eliminating the 
                            need for long gear trains. The final product I designed uses a custom set of gears designed in 
                            Autodesk Inventor to enable a full planetary gear assembly to fit around a standard VEX shaft. 
                            The wheel design is designed to interface with standard VEX Omni-wheel components for ease of use 
                            and to cut down on manufacturing and assembly time. This project forced me to balance multiple 
                            aspects of design, including manufacturing time, efficiency, and practicality.

                        <p>
                            This project is my most mechanically advanced project to date.  I worked closely with my team
                            and designed this over the course of an entire school year. It includes numerous subsystems, such as the drivetrain, the intake,
                             the linear-launcher, and the winch release. Perhaps the highlight of the build is the winch release
                            system. Conventional slipgear systems would not work, because multiple full revolutions were required to fully retract the 
                            linear launcher, so my team came up with a creative solution: a release arm that physically seperated the gears to avoid motor damage.
                            The linear launcher system that my team and I developed gave the robot
                            a near perfect disk grouping that minimized the number of missed disks, and qualified our team for the World Championships.
                            See the VEX Robotics Spin Up game reveal for more information.
