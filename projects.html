                        <p>
                            I spent some time working with a partner on a software package to solve a simple maze. 
                            The maze was constructed such that signs on the walls pointed the way to the goal, 
                            and were key to solving the maze. Aditya and I created a ROS2/Python package to solve 
                            the maze by using machine learning to predict what the signs are, and then traveling to 
                            waypoints using ROS2 NAV2. Our final submission achieved 90% sign classification accuracy, 
                            and was able to complete the maze properly and without error in 5/6 tests.

                        <p>
                            I worked with a team of seven other Clemson ME students to design a Clean-In-Place Skid system to 
                            specifications laid out by the Fluor Corporation. I focused heavily on the conceptual design side of the project, 
                            doing much of my work in the areas of CAD design, flow and heat calculations, and equipment purchasing. 
                            I also acted as the Group Liason, ensuring useful and professional communcation with the sponsors at Fluor, 
                            the advisors at Clemson, and any suppliers we spoke with.

                        <h3>VEX Compatible Planetary Wheels</h3>
                        <p>
                            I started this project with the goal of innovating on conventional VEX Robotics drivetrains by 
                            improving the space efficiency of the systems. My goal was to design a wheel that could fit a 
                            planetary gear train inside of it to enable competitive drivetrain speeds while eliminating the 
                            need for long gear trains. The final product I designed uses a custom set of gears designed in 
                            Autodesk Inventor to enable a full planetary gear assembly to fit around a standard VEX shaft. 
                            The wheel design is designed to interface with standard VEX Omni-wheel components for ease of use 
                            and to cut down on manufacturing and assembly time. This project forced me to balance multiple 
                            aspects of design, including manufacturing time, efficiency, and practicality.
