            <h2>Graduate Researcher</h2>
            <h3>Laboratory for Intelligent Decision and Robotics  |  January 2026 - Present</h3>
            <p>
                I am currently involved with a project to retrofit a tactile sensor and apply it to a humanoid robot. 
                I will be working on designing components to facilitate mounting, 
                and I will be tasked with modifying the measurement software to fit with the new setup. 
                The ultimate goal is to apply the sensor to an intelligent force response system on a humanoid robot.

            <h2>Undergraduate Researcher</h2>
            <h3>Clemson University International Center for Automotive Research   |  May 2021 - August 2021</h3>
            <p>
                I worked on using mobile devices and deep learning technology to aid drivers with visual impairments. 
                Over the course of the program, I worked on developing an Android application that used a simple deep-learning model to classify road signs, 
                and then alert the user of their presence. I was able to work with some of the fundamentals of machine learning and image processing while 
                while applying my knowledge to a project with a real world impact. After completing my project, 
                I presented my results to a panel of peers, professors, and industry professionals.

            <h2>Lead Mechanical Designer</h2>
            <h3>Clemson VEXU Robotics Club |  August 2022 - May 2024</h3>
            <p>
                As Lead Mechanical Designer, I designed, manufactured, and evaluated functional components of robots. 
                This included moving components, such as gears for powertrains, and static components, such as chassis supports. 
                I was also tasked with designing subsystems of the robot to accomplish various tasks. 
                These generally included various forms of chassis, end effector, and launcher subsystems. 
                I worked closely with the programming and construction subteams to ensure my designs were 
                both functional and reasonable. During my time, I was able to help my team reach the VEXU World Championships.

            <h3>Clemson Fencing Club  |  August 2024 - May 2025</h3>
            <p>
                As club armorer I was in charge of managing upkeep of equipment of a club with approximately fifty members. 
                I worked with basic electrical equipment such as circuits and multimeters to troubleshoot and repair damaged equipment
                I maintained a system to keep track of equipment owned by the club, any repairs necessary for any broken equipment, and any 
                new equipment that needed to be purchased.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, I was able to coach the saber team at Clemson, due to my long time experience with the sport. I mentored both new
                and experienced fencers to build the competetive and community sprit of the club.

            <h2>Saber Squad Leader</h2>
            <h3>Yellowjacket Fencing Club  |  January 2026 - Present</h3>
            <p>
                As a saber squad leader in the Yellowjacket Fencing club, I oversee practice with the other squad leaders, and help the
                team officers make competetive decisions. I coach and advise new fencers and lead practice on a regular basis.
